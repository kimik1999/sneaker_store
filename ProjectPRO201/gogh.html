            <p> Vans and the Van Gogh Museum proudly partner to present an artfully designed 
                collection<br> utilizing Van Gogh masterpieces across iconic Vans Classics and premium apparel silhouettes,<br>
                available worldwide August 3. The Van Gogh Museum will dedicate a portion of its profits<br> from this project 
                to the preservation of Vincent van Gogh’s legacy and collection of art; <br> keeping it accessible for future generations.
            </p>
            <img src="sl1.jpg" width="780px"/>
            <p>Vincent van Gogh is arguably one of the most famous and influential post-impressionist <br>
                painters in the history of western art. Van Gogh is most noted for his work that evokes beauty,<br>
                 emotion and color bringing his personal expression to life through his art. 
                 With over 2,100 pieces<br> of artwork produced from his decade long career,
                  Vans worked closely with the Van Gogh Museum<br> team to select four main bodies of work
                   that speaks to the creative ethos of Vans’ design as well as<br> personal moments from the artist familial history.
                    Skull, Almond Blossom, Sunflowers and Van Gogh’s<br> self-portrait are celebrated through an extensive Vans collection,
                     showcasing some of Van Gogh’s<br> most revered artwork in a new way.  </p>
                     <img src="sl2.jpg" width="780px;">
            <p>
                    “We are delighted with the Vans x Van Gogh Museum collection,
                    as it ties in with our mission to<br> make the life and work of Vincent 
                    van Gogh accessible to as many people as possible in order to <br>enrich and
                     inspire them”, said Adriaan Dönszelmann, Managing Director of the Van Gogh Museum. <br>
                     “By uniting Van Gogh’s iconic artworks with iconic Vans styles, 
                     our partnership brings Vincent’s art<br> “Off The Wall” and into the world to a new audience outside the museum.”<br>
                     <br>
                    When Van Gogh began to formally study art, he centered his focus around color theory through
                     a <br>series of skeletons that captured shade and light in an irreverent and dark expression.
                      These studies <br>have come to life across the vamps of the Classic Slip-On, long sleeve tee, 
                      hoodie and hat with Van<br> Gogh’s human skull placed expertly across each silhouette with subtle 
                      details of the artist’s handwriting<br> and brush strokes hidden in a reimagined checkerboard print. 
            </p>
            <img src="sl3.jpg" width="780px;">
            <p>More colorful renditions come from two of Van Gogh’s most recognized works, Sunflowers and <br> Almond Blossom.
                 Van Gogh created five large canvases that depicted sunflowers in a vase using <br>three shades of yellow to help
                  demonstrate the ability to create an image with varying degrees of color <br>and texture all while using single color tones.
                   The Sunflowers painting has been dissected to cover<br> every panel of the Authentic and is carried through to the Sunflower Boyfriends 
                   Tee and the Sunflower Hoodie.<br> Almond Blossom symbolizes new life and represents Van Gogh’s search for serenity and to bring
                    the print and its <br>colors to life Vans designers digitally printed Van Gogh’s painting atop a satin material to cover the<br> 
                    Almond Blossom Bomber, hat and backpack. </p>
                    <img src="sl4.jpg" width="780px;">
                    <p>
                            The collection showcases the evolution of Van Gogh’s painting style with his  self-portrait where he<br>  captures himself using bright,
                             unblended colors and a new technique of pairing complimentary colors<br> to create depth and intensity. Van Gogh’s self-portrait can 
                             be found wrapped atop the Authentic and<br> a complimenting Van Gogh Oversized Tee.
                             <br><br>
                            The final round-up of designs includes an ode to Van Gogh’s drawing titled Old Vineyard with Peasant<br> Woman which is delicately 
                            printed across the Old Skool and a special Classic Slip-On that features<br> excerpts from handwritten letters from Vincent to his brother,
                             Theo. Vans designers pulled excerpts<br> and illustrations from some of the 700 letters that were sent to Theo and have wrapped them
                             across<br> the Classic Slip-On model. Both the Old Skool and Classic Slip-On models will be sold at select Vans <br>retail and wholesale accounts.
