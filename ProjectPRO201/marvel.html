            <p> Sharing a rich heritage rooted in creative expression and empowerment, Vans and Marvel join <br>
                forces once again to launch their largest collaboration to date. Celebrating the “Off The Wall” Super <br>
                Heroes of the Marvel Universe, Vans introduces an extensive range of co-branded footwear, <br> 
                apparel and accessories featuring an all-star roster of iconic personas including The Avengers, <br>
                Black Panther, Deadpool, Iron Man, Hulk and more! The Vans x Marvel collection is an epic <br>
                collaboration for the ages, assembling a massive line-up of 70-plus styles for fans of all ages. <br>
                <br>
                The Vans x Marvel collection kicks off with a selection of footwear inspired by The Avengers. <br>
                Representing the Super Hero squad, a custom Old Skool has been outfitted with a unique color  <br>
                story to symbolize key members; a vivid blue toe-box and shield graphic heel counter are a nod to <br>
                Captain America while the shoe tongue has been reimagined to mimic a piece of Iron Man’s high- <br>
                tech suit of armor. Finishing details include a silver leather wing Sidestripe that takes styling cues <br>
                from the all-mighty Thor and a brightly colored outsole that don Hulk’s signature green and purple <br>
                tones. The Authentic presents a more subtle aesthetic, showcasing additional Marvel Super Heroes <br>
                such Black Panther, Black Widow and Spider-Man in an allover print that also matches back to a <br>
                selection of men’s t-shirts, hat, sandal and sock options as well as a special checkered apparel <br>
                pack just for women. <br>
            </p>

            <p> <br>
                Black Panther, Hulk and Spider-Man are seen once again in the collection with their own dedicated <br>
                capsules. Stylized with heavy-duty ripstop, claw-like hardware and embossed embellishments, the <br>
                Black Panther Sk8-Hi references King T’Challa’s vibranium suit. Black Panther makes another <br>
                appearance on the Vans x Marvel short sleeve tee and Torrey jacket, combining classic comic book <br>
                artwork with vintage Vans graphics. The Classic Slip-On showcases Hulk’s amazing strength as his <br>
                feet burst through the checkerboard pattern of Vans’ cherished lace-free sneaker. Hulk fans can <br>
                rejoice in building an incredible head-to-toe look, as he has his own hat, t-shirt and sock styles <br>
                while She Hulk makes her debut on the Vans x Marvel Pull Over Hoodie and short sleeve tee. <br>
                Spider-Man’s superhuman abilities are on full display across the Classic Slip-On sneaker and Slide- <br>
                On sandal while his spider web motifs and core colors influence the design of additional men’s, <br>
                women’s and kid’s apparel and accessory pieces. Like a true arch nemesis, Venom counters <br>
                Spider-Man’s vivid colors with a small-yet-sinister apparel offering that features the symbiotic Super <br>
                Villain’s menacing grin. Deadpool makes a surprise cameo in the Vans x Marvel collection with a <br>
                special colorway of the Sk8-Hi. Detailed in durable red and black leather, Vans’ coveted high-top is <br>
                inspired by Deadpool’s suit, with weapons such as the katana and ninja stars embedded in its build <br>
                for added protection against foes.

                upgraded materials, rare patterns and signature colors across the assortment of women’s apparel, <br>
                accessories and footwear. The Classic Slip-On pays homage to Black Widow with sleek nylon <br>
                uppers and a beveled outsole in an all-black colorway like her bodysuit. A rubberized Black Widow <br> 
                logo is outlined in red for a subtle contrast and ballistic canvas quarter panels put the finishing <br>
                touches on this stealthy style. Captain Marvel’s heroic hues empower the Sk8-Hi with red suede <br>
                and blue canvas uppers while gold covers the Sidestripe and accents the back-heel counter with a <br>
                cut-out eight-point star, Captain Marvel’s cherished emblem. Captain Marvel makes her apparel <br>
                debut on a pullover, ringer tee and crew tee in her own “Off The Wall” logo pose; her suit’s colors <br> 
                and iconography inspire brand new backpack and crew sock accessories. The women of Marvel <br>
                team up for a special, graphic-focused capsule that includes the Authentic, Slide-On sandal and an <br> 
                assortment of women’s apparel and accessories. The action-packed allover print features <br>
